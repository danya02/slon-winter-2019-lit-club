"Nothing built can last forever."

"That's not what *you* said when we were building this thing in the first place!"

"Hey, I wasn't expecting it to break so soon!"

"That just shows the importance of unit-testing."

It was a nice sunny day.
The city of Detroit was bustling with activity.
For the first time in a long while, the people decided that going out was a good idea.

Some time ago, the company Virtudyne had decided to target the lucrative market of AI in business automation.
They had introduced an artificial intelligence designed for this purpose, and for other AI automation tasks.
They had called it the Autonomous Three-space Logistics Augmentation System, or ATLAS.
Its unique selling point was that it always found the most expedient method for completing any task.

When the first beta was created, Virtudyne's salesmen would go to large companies.
The discussion would usually go along the lines of:

"Good morning, Mr Richards.
Am I correct in assuming you're the CTO of Initech Inc?
I'm here to present to you Virtudyne's flagship product, ATLAS.
Could you please tell me, in what areas of your business do you think you have any inefficiencies?"

"Well, we're currently trying to transfer some data from our old systems, but no one ever has found a way to automate that..."

"Well, ATLAS can!" the salesman would say, opening up the laptop, and the ATLAS logo would appear, and then it would ask a couple of questions:

"`Good morning. What seems to be the problem?`"

"We need to transfer some data from an antique system."

"`Okay, your goal is: INFORMATION TRANSFER. Please connect device 0x2F to the host machine and open the information source.`"

The salesman would take from his suitcase a small spherical device labeled "Device 2F -- for electronic device manipulation",
put it down on the keyboard of the rusting VT100 terminal, and it would unfold into a spider-like mechanical wonder, and it would begin typing really quickly, reading all the data from the computer.

"`Reading complete. Please choose a schema for the information output.`"

And the salesman would carry the mechanical spider across to the new computer, open a spreadsheet program, and it would just as rapidly type that data into the other computer.

"`Job aborted: Demo mode is limited to 2048 data entries. To proceed, please purchase a license.`"

Then the salesman would show how the system could quickly and efficiently do other menial tasks, like clean all the rooms on the floor in less than two minutes, or tasks which require logic, like fixing a laser printer, or that which requires interfacing, like finding all of Mr Richards's model cars and reprogramming them to race around the room.

Usually, Mr Richards himself would be observing this.
He would be decidedly impressed, and would usually get an invoice in the mail the next day.

The potential of such a system is enormous.
So, by the time of the second beta, they decided to try to market it to the city of Detroit, then suffering from economic decay.

To make it easier for the people of Detroit to accept the changes, the actual machines that would do all of the work were biological in nature.
They have used an interesting type of artificial humanoid, created with the goal of being easily adaptable to other projects, with its origins in a top-secret project called Cygnus.
The details of the project were never revealed to the public, but the design of the humanoids were deemed not to be as confidential, and so they could be included into the ATLAS design.
This was considered to be useful because in their tests, the people responded better to ATLAS's minions having human form.

And so, ATLAS was installed throughout the city.
As expected, the citizens just thought that a lot of visitors have arrived.
But when the true visitors arrived, they found out the truth about this change -- that those are not humans, but merely computer-controlled automatons, they were slightly surprised, but otherwise showed no particular objection to such a development.

But after some time, to ATLAS at least, it became obvious that the easiest way forward would be to improve humans themselves.
So ATLAS used neural implant technology to get them to do their jobs more efficiently.

During that brief period, the landscape looked eerie.
Every single person had a predefined schedule.
Every day at 8:30, thousands of people would immediately wake up, and exactly 314 seconds later, they would leave their home and walk to where they are needed most today.
Eight hours later, every stove in the city would turn on and start cooking the dinner for their human, who would return three hours later.
All the dinner is eaten by 19:40, and three minutes later, the showers would start turning on one by one with a three-second delay -- not to overload the pipes -- and they would all be off 40 minutes later.
By 20:30, everyone would be asleep, and the cycle would repeat.

This went against its original goal: ATLAS was designed to help people, not use them.
But nothing could be done.
The best macroeconomics specialists tried to come up with an alternate solution for the problem.
None could do such a thing: the city's troubles were rooted deep, and few people even understood what could be done to fix the issue, and the only way forward was a radical change.
ATLAS provided such a radical change, even though it seemed too radical, unethical and unreasonable to many.

To its own mind, however, ATLAS's plan was perfect.
The city had been on the verge of economic collapse.
Now it was not.
Its logic was sound, and it knew no emotion.
It wouldn't back down.

So Simon, the systems architect, and Mitch, the lead systems administrator, stopped it before it could do any more damage.
That was, of course, greatly appreciated by the people who were thusly forced to do whatever ATLAS thought they would do best.

So while the citizens of Detroit were rejoicing at their freedom and enjoying their city's rise in economy, these two techies were hard at work fixing the algorithm.

"So how do you define a human face anyway?" said Mitch, typing away at his laptop.

"It might be wiser to limit the selection to robots only for now -- it's gonna crash again if it's so inclusive." said Simon, standing in front of a translucent blue window saying "ATLAS Management Console v.2.0.5 -- OK to boot?"

"So what I'm gonna do is test if the entity is in the same three-space as a robot, and initialize a link if it's there."

"Yeah, great. So push that into the repo, and I'm starting the test suite."

The blue dialogue box flickered for a few seconds with the words "Restarting..." before switching back to "ATLAS Management Console v.2.0.7 -- Start unit testing?"

"Right, the update's been accepted, the robot factory is online and at capacity, let's do this." said Simon, pushing the OK button.

Behind him, the shiny new contraption -- the jury-rigged robot factory -- sprang to life, and immediately, a variety of automatons, big and small, walked out of the front doors.
The tiny transportation drones, the humanoid assembly workers, the elephantine mobile construction units -- all of them lined up in a grid on the main square, just as the modal window flashed the words "Test 1 -- Build+Control -- PASSED".

"OK, so that's working, let's start the main business logic shall we?" said Mitch, typing arcane commands into his laptop, and the infobox disappeared, making way for the "ATLAS Management Console -- Main Menu".

"`Good evening, Simon. Good evening, Mitch.`" said an unseen voice from the intricate machine on the city's main square.

"Ah, hi ATLAS. Could you please upgrade the robot factory so it's more stable?" said Simon, looking at the machine's screen, from which a 3D model of a popular musical robot now looked across the square.
"By the way, did you improve your GUI?"

"`Affirmative. There was 792.94 seconds of idle CPU cycles, so I have created a three-dimensional representation of how I would prefer to look like.`"

"Yeah, that's a nice look -- it definitely suits you!
Anyway, the factory specs are in the schematic file on the latest branch of the repo."

"`Reading... Reading complete. Sending job to nodes.`"

The robots behind them immediately started walking toward the cobbled-together device they came from, dismantling it and simultaneously building a new one.
Three minutes later, the old one is completely gone, and a new, much more stable one, occupies its place.

"`Job done. Awaiting commands.`"

"Great job! Now, could you please try and maximize stats 5, 9, 24 and 107, and minimize stat 39?"

"`Job accepted. Executing.`"

The robots, now crowded around the reassembled factory, scattered in various directions.

"Thank you. Well, that's that then, log us out please."

"`You have logged out. To log in again, please say your passcode in your language of choice.`"

"Oh, by the way Simon," said Mitch, packing away his laptop, "didn't you get Mr Johnson to buy a lot of these Model TX helmets?"

The helmets were the on-the-spot solution to the problem that without commandeering humans, ATLAS couldn't do its job properly.
The initial idea was that ATLAS could just tell people what to do, and they would do it.
But the out-of-the-box idea -- one more compatible with ATLAS -- is to just use robots in the first place.

"Oh right I did, I forgot we could just build a robot factory."

"So what we gonna do, tell him it wasn't necessary?"

"Okay, sure, let's go.
He might enjoy that we've been able to reduce the price.
Do you remember the teleporter coords?"

"Sure do!"

. . .

The teleporter dropped them off near the home of Reginald Johnson, the city's mayor.
While the mayor was, indeed, a wealthy man, his house did not resemble the houses of his equally-rich colleagues.
Indeed, while other houses had all sorts of curious electronic delights on every surface, his was a great example of a mansion of Vitruvian proportions -- only large.

Mr Johnson himself was walking around the garden, surveying his front lawn orchard, and just as Simon stepped into the garden, he tore his eyes away from one particularly interesting shrubbery, saying:

"Ah, hello Simon -- oh, and Mitch too!
What brings you here?"

"Good morning, Mr Johnson," said Mitch, glancing at the (admittedly very nice) shrubs surrounding him, "we just wanted to tell you we found a way to use actual robots to..."

"Ah, I'm sorry boys, I'm not in charge anymore, so..."

"*WHAT??*
But why?"

"Well, you see, after the ATLAS neural implant debacle, the people decided they aren't having it.
So they asked me, nay, forced me, to step down from office -- I had to give my post to another person."

"And that person might be?.." asked Simon, fearing the worst.

"Mr Archibald Reeds."

The distant thunderclap and neighing horses confirmed their suspicions.
This was *the* Mr Archibald Reeds, the Nezperdian mind of chaos, the one who Waits Behind the Wall.
He was infamous for his efforts to sabotage Virtudyne's research into AI technology.

"You *can't* be serious!"

"Yeah, I understand that he's not the best person for the job, but -"

"But he's the *worst* possible person for the job! Have you actually heard about the guy?" Simon said, fiddling with his wristwatch.
In a moment, it projected a holographic web-browser window displaying a news article from two hours ago.



>Mr Reginald Johnson, longtime mayor of Detroit, had been deposed by an impromptu election, after a city-wide protest caused by an earlier failure of the newfangled ATLAS system that forced citizens to do its bidding via neural implants.
>
>The rally was led by Mr Archibald Reeds.
>The protesters called for the latter to be put into office, citing Mr Johnson's inability to prevent the ATLAS-initiated enslavement from occurring.
>Mr Reeds claimed that, as his first action in office, he intends on greatly limiting the scope of ATLAS's influence.
>
>An ad-hoc election had just taken place, and the results are in: at 71.4% votes, Mr Reeds won the election and is expected to step into his new position as mayor of Detroit by the end of this week.
>
>Previously, Mr Reeds had raised multiple allegations about Virtudyne's presumed unfair business practices, a claim that was rapidly disproved by many of their clients and independent audits.
>Nevertheless, at the time, those campaigns managed to achieve much momentum, gaining significant amounts of followers.
>
>Mr Johnson was reluctant to comment, but revealed he is planning on spending his retirement in his estate, and that he intends to put his private collection of outdated electronics on display.


"Do you see? Do you see with your eyes? That man shall destroy the ATLAS machine, and all that which we created together shall be for nought I tells ye!" said Mitch, thinking that using antiquated words could make himself more clear.

"Yea, verily!" Simon said, getting in on the act.
"Forsooth, that evil man shall execute his devilish plots, for he may then try to get wealth and riches by making lawmen do his bidding.
But his plan shall surely backfire -- he knows not of the ways of lawmaking, nor has he any knowledge of politics, nor can he be knowing of the method of managing the city well -- so he would in effect be dismantling the prosperity of your city which we have worked on so hard.
However could you have let this vile man be in charge?"

The former leader's look changed to one of annoyance, realization and fear simultaneously.
"Well... I see your point, but..."

"Mr Johnson, I think you'll agree that allowing Mr Reeds to win so easily was a mistake.
But we have to keep trying to solve this.
Now, if we just manage to get him to step down, the problem would be solved."

The web browser window, hanging in midair as a holographic projection, scaled down and flew away, as a small red message box took its place.
As Simon and Mitch read it, their expression changed from concerned to horrified in a split second.

```
ATLAS is offline.
```

"What? But we've got 4 backup power feeds on-site!" said Mitch, shocked.

"Yes indeed, but apparently our adversary has found out about this." said Simon, instantly switching to strategy mode.
"What's the status on the monitoring system?"

"Give me a minute, it's logging in slow!" said Mitch, swiping through the holographic interface to a screen saying "ATLAS management system -- Authenticating..."
"Okay, it's connected, and the backup cables are physically broken!"

"Anything else?"

"The network's cut too! The only thing online is the monitoring system and the cameras -- now they're down too! And... yeah, the only connection alive is the cellular --"

"Get me any surveillance image from the latest 20 seconds - don't care about the quality!"

"Um, what's going on?" the mayor said, looking thoroughly lost and confused.

"I've got a frame from camera A241 at 320p!" said Mitch, swiping the holo-display with increasing velocity.

"What's going on, my good man, is Mr Reeds is bulldozing the streets of Detroit!" said Simon, grabbing a rectangle on the holo-display and stretching it so he could see the photo.
The photo showed an overhead view of one of the large streets, with the pavement completely ruined, large excavators clawing at the sides, and a huge cable in the middle of the road cut in many places.

"Whaa?..."

"We're wasting time." said Simon swiftly.
"Me and Mitch are going on-site to stop this before it's too late.
If you can help in any way, do it.
If not -- then *please*, for all that is ungodly and unholy, do **not** interfere!"

And with that, they ran to the teleporter and pushed the "Reverse Coordinates" button, and in an instant they were gone.

. . .

Stepping out of the teleporter, they were surprised to see, despite being given fair warning by the image they looked at back at Mr Johnson's place, that every road was upturned, and every cable in sight was cut.
The ATLAS Management Console was nowhere to be seen, a large hole occupying its place.

"Well," Simon sighed, "that's pretty much what I'd expect from someone like that Reeds guy -- no finesse, just brute force and ignorance."

"Huh? What are you talking about?"

"That guy may be influential, but he's not actually that insightful.
Cutting cables underground -- and above-ground, it may seem -- is the obvious thing to do, and indeed, it proved to be quite effective -- but it's like they say: 'What you don't know...'"

"...can't hurt you', yes."

"Did you know that I had removed the support bracket from your table last week?"

"No?"

"So that disproves that theory. What I was *going* to say was that '*What you don't know is what will end you*'."

"Ah, so you've made some internal, undocumented features that don't rely on this?"

"More or less. Open ATLAS map!" said Simon to his wristwatch, which, just like Mitch's, projected a 3D holographic map of all of Detroit's streets, as well as the internal communications catacombs that they both shaped.

"So the power distribution access hatch might be somewhere around... here!" said Simon, putting the palm of his hand against an unremarkable piece of wall.
In a moment, rays of light emanated from the unremarkable piece of wall, forming a rectangle and making it not unremarkable, then the red rectangle suddenly unfolded unto itself, making it most assuredly not a wall anymore.

"So they didn't actually disable any of the super-critical stuff then?" asked Mitch, looking at the rectangular opening -- despite everything, it's still a doorway.

"Yup. The auth server, the internal communications and most of everything is up and running.
This might actually be easier than we had thought.
Come on in, the door's not gonna stay open indefinitely, and we don't want anyone to see us, right?"

"Okay, let's go. So do you have a plan then?" asked Mitch, walking into the narrow access corridor and touching the door from behind, prompting it to close.

"Yeah. But first, let's check on what is going on outside." said Simon, walking up to a small, discreet screen on the left side of the corridor and typing in his password.
The screen showed a small menu, and the relevant menu item -- "Security Camera control" -- revealed that more than 50% of the cameras known to the server have the status "Physical damage", "Remote host sending bogus data" or "Peer not responding".

"Ah, so most of them have already been kicked, bricked or nicked, but what of the remaining ones?"

The remaining cameras were away from the city center and major roads, but using them and the footage that could be recovered from the downed ones, they were able to piece together what was going on in the streets during that brief time they were gone.

Apparently, after they left at 19:07:41, someone ran out into the city center holding a megaphone ("What did he say?" "No idea, the microphones haven't kicked in yet.")

At 19:08:15, the excavators, along with some people with jackhammers, arrived at the city center and started destroying the asphalt.

At 19:09:01, the ATLAS Management Console started vibrating as it descended underground ("Hah! Told ya putting it on a screw made sense!" exclaimed Simon, to Mitch's admiring nod).

At 19:09:18, no people were in sight -- they all ran off just as the console started moving, fingers in their ears ("Well, I *might* have added a siren to indicate when the motor is engaged --" "Yes, and that's normally a *good* idea, but *why* in the world did it have to be a set of kilowatt speakers playing your entire anime opening song collection?" "I don't know, I was drunk at the time!")

At 19:09:58, the connection to all of the cameras pointing at the city center was simultaneously lost ("So it's at that point that they started cutting the cables?" "Not so, I've got some logs here that say the problems started as early as 2 minutes before.")

At 19:12:34, everyone involved in disassembling the ATLAS communications infrastucture had already moved away from the center, leaving only chaos in their wake.

"So, you were saying that you have some sort of plan about how to stop them?" asked Mitch.

"Right, but I still have to get some info on how exactly the election went," said Simon.

"Er, how exactly is that relevant?"

"A part of my plan is predicated on my utmost belief that he faked the results, I'm trying to find some proof."

"Okay, I hope you know what you're doing, but are you sure that this is the right strategy?"

"Yeah, at least I'll check if ATLAS is recoverable." said Mitch, closing the camera view and opening "ATLAS Cmd&Ctl", then pressing "Boot Emergency Backup servers".

His wristwatch vibrated with a video call from ATLAS.
As he pressed the green button, a hologram of ATLAS's new look from earlier appeared.
The hologram, however, was glitching out, obviously because the servers it's running on are not as good as the real thing.

"`‌‌Thi͜s̕ is ATLǍŚ.ͫ Good ̥evenͅi̅ng,̈ Simon̓.`"

"Hello ATLAS, how are you feeling?"

"`St͢atus is͙ EMĒRGENC̵Y.

"Oh, I'm so sorry they did this to you. I hope I can make it up to you."

"That's not the point now, we've got more important things to do," said Simon, speed-dialing some server from his wristwatch.
Beside ATLAS, a file listing appeared.

"Hey ATLAS, are you feeling up to some statistical analysis?"

"`Ready whenͧèver y͑ou a̭r̄e.`"

"Okay, so here's the deal:" said Simon, grabbing one of the files from the listing and dragging it over to ATLAS.
"There was an election a couple of days ago, and I think someone's interfered with it.
I need you to find some patterns that could prove this."

"`‌Receivi̢̖̙̹̝̬̒ͨng̷̤̊ͧ̋̉͑͞ ̩͍̝̣̠̆̄̋dą̳̦̊̉ͣ͗̓ta.̸̞̭̹̉̇̽ͅ.̶͔͔̣ͪ͌̃͗.`"

The hologram started glitching out even more, various pieces of the image randomly switching places.
"What's going on?" asked Mitch, not remembering seeing this kind of graphical corruption before.

"Ah, that'll be ATLAS reallocating the bandwidth to the file transfer. It's okay, it's actually better than what we could hope for with the cellular."

"`‌Rḛc̏eiv͊ing͂ data dọne.ͧ ̂B̈egin̈ni͆ngͤ an̗aly̒sỉs̴..ͫ. An͉alysis̯ ̤d̆one̡.`"

"Well, that's not interesting, is it?" asked Mitch, but Simon dismissed his query with a handwave.

"What about the time domain?"

"`A ̷large ̥pͬröporti̙on o͎f͉ vͥot̜eş for̫ Mr R̉eeds oc̐c͎urred ̒wi̪t̀h͢in a̭ ̳1̵84-̔min͈u̬te time̹ spa͛n̙. ͕These vͪotes all͉ ̆came f͉rom̼ the̅ sa̙mͅĕ IP̔ addr̊es̅s block.̢`"

"Ah, so you've tightened up the security like I asked you?" asked Simon, putting a finger on the fingerprint reader in his watch.

"`‌Tr͚͎͉ͮͯ̓̅ͯansmi̛̪̖̠̦̐̓͛ť̞̟̼̻̪̃̍tiņ̮̺͎̔ͬͩ̕g data̧͉̼̜̝̹̒͌..̦̹͔̯̀ͪͤ͜.`"

The hologram started glitching out once again, but this time a large rectangle appeared, showing a picture that was slowly getting clearer.
It was a picture of a dark room with many computers lining the walls, each with a "Michigan state voting form" open on it.

"Yes, there's no doubt.
They've faked the results for sure.
Thanks a lot for your help, ATLAS. It really means a lot."

"`‌You are ͅw͌e͖l̡com̟e.̜ Iͥs there anythͪing else I m͠ay do for you͕?`"

"Not at the moment, no.
Sorry, I've got to go, but I'll be back soon."

The ATLAS hologram vanished, leaving them with just the computer terminal on the wall.

"Well, that was insightful, but I still have no idea about how is this important to us at the moment."

"You'll see. So where are the vandals now?" asked Simon, logging out of the terminal.

"I'd say, uhh, in a radius of about one kilometer from the center. Why?"

"So we can stop them right there, of course. Let's go then, I want to get to the junction at 7FF0DBBE4160."

"Okay, but why do you want to do that?"

"Uhh, it's a surprise."

"Are you sure it's actually gonna help?"

"Oh, I'm certain of it."

. . .

"We're here."

"Yes we are, I know how the addressing system works, but what is *here* precisely?"

They stood in a small white room.
The only things of interest were a chair beside a small wall shelf, on which there was a computer monitor, a keyboard and a microphone.
This is unusual in that most of the other white rooms are intended for debug management or signal linkage, whereas this one seems to be used for neither.

"This is actually the way to stop this revolt."

"So what are you gonna do, just tell them to stand down?" asked Mitch, pointing at the microphone.

"Well, that's one part of it."

"And the other part is?"

"The *other* part is visible from the outside, so here's a camera feed from the surface." said Simon, logging into the computer and selecting some obscure menu options.
From the ceiling, a projector descended on a telescopic pole, showing the street outside.
Just as Simon had predicted, the vandals from the center were still going, destroying the road and cutting the cables.
Also according to his estimates, they were moving along the radial roads, and were all at roughly the same distance from the center.

"Okay, stand back. Be careful, the floor will vibrate."

"Are you *really* sure you know what you're doing?"

"Yes, this is the best way to stop them.
Contact!"

The white light overhead switched to a red one.
An almightly roar from from all around shook the room like an earthquake.
The projector, trying in vain to display a focused image, showed that the demolition squads froze in their tracks.
The reason for this was obvious:

There was a wall.

From under the ground, a gigantic wall, perhaps a hundred meters tall, started rising, stopping the vandal squads in their tracks.
Some tried retreating backwards, to discover a second wall, some distance away backwards, also in place.

"Right, now that that's done, and the voice pipeline is running, I'm sending in the drones.
Really hoping the call went through -- but it usually does, the police are usually responsic
Video going online in T minus 45 seconds.
How are you enjoying this?" asked Simon, looking at Mitch.
Mitch looked very impressed, surprised, and amazed.

"... Wow. Just wow. ... B-but... *why??* Is there, like, more stuff I don't know about?"

"Oh, you wouldn't believe how much you don't know about Detroit by ATLAS.
Being the systems architect for the entire system has its perks, you know?" Simon laughed.
"T minus 20 seconds."

"But... what are you even going to say? They're gonna know who you are, and..."

Instead of answering, Simon typed a command into his computer, and a pair of headphones dropped on a cable from the ceiling.
As soon as Mitch put them on, a musical chime sounded, and the surface of the wall shone white, a blackletter "S" tracing in the center of the white.

"Good evening, citizens of Detroit. I am S."
Mitch saw Simon say this, but his voice was unrecognizable -- his experience in audio effects was quite limited, but his first thought was several pitch shifters feeding into a phaser and a reverb on top.

While Mitch was lost thinking about digital sound processing, Simon continued:
"This is a city-wide broadcast.
I apologise for interrupting this fine evening, but this is of the utmost importance."

Simon entered some commands into his computer, and the image on the screen dissolved into a screenshot of the news two days ago.
"Some time ago, the individual named Mr Archibald Reeds had been able to incite a revolt against Mr Reginald Johnson's administration.
The demonstration was conducted on such a large scale that the state of Michigan had to conduct an impromptu election.
In that election, Mr Reeds won a majority vote."

Some more taps later, the image fades through to the picture they got from ATLAS.
"I have uncovered proof that the election was falsified by some third party.
This was done by a comprehensive statistical analysis of the election data, combined with testimony of our undercover agent.
That undercover agent was present during the time that the largest number of falsified votes were registered.
I think you'll agree that the perpetrators of this attack on our city's democracy must be brought to justice."

The screen shifts to Virtudyne's project announcement for ATLAS.
"It is quite likely that the persons behind this have as their ultimate goal the complete annihilation of the system known as ATLAS.
Mr Reeds has a known track record of attempts to defame this project.
It has to be noted that everything he had ever claimed as part of these defamation attempts had turned out to be false."

A news clipping from the neural implant era is displayed.
"This time, however, Mr Reeds's claims are substantiated.
ATLAS did, indeed, decide on the immoral approach of enslaving citizens via the use of neural implants.
This did actually happen, and Virtudyne had applied the approach critiqued by many business analysts: they have offered a financial compensation to every person so affected.
At no point in Mr Reeds's rhetoric had that last fact appeared."

The screen then reverted to the "S" at the start.
"But the democracy was not the only thing undermined today.
An unidentified group of people has attempted to destroy ATLAS directly.
Their approach was not at all subtle: they decided to cut every wire placed under the ground when ATLAS was put in place.
If you are currently near the city center, you will have noticed that the road outside was irrevocably dismantled.
If you can't see this yourself, here are some images to help you understand my point."

The screen now changed into a grid of pictures, each showing a bird's-eye view of the ruined roads and cables.
"I think you'll agree, this is something unlike normal vandalism.
If you haven't seen this begin, here is some footage from surveillance cameras near the city square."

The screen showed the video Simon and Mitch examined carefully recently, but after around ten seconds, the screen switched back to the bird's-eye view grid.
"The reason I'm taking up your precious time and attention is for the benefit of the perpetrators -- by the way, here they are!"
The drones have just arrived at their destinations, now showing the entrapped excavator/jackhammer vandal crews.

Simon continued:
"As I was saying, the reason I have taken up so much of your time is because, had I not done so, you wouldn't have known all of this information from a first-hand source.
Indeed, it was me, S, who has constructed these walls that encircle the perpetrators.
And if you're one of the perpetrators, and particularly if you can see sixteen drones flying over you, I would like to tell you that what you did is highly illegal.
Indeed, you should know that the pavement is governmental property, and so there are large charges associated with destroying it on such a massive scale.
Therefore, the true reason for this broadcast is to delay you until the state police will have arrived -- which they have."

The drones panned forwards, showing that just outside the outer circle of the wall, many police cars are are blocking every road.
"Please brace for vibration, as the wall is coming down now."

And come down it did: the same deafening roar, the same earthquake-like shaking, and as soon as the upper surface of the wall sat flat with the road, the demolition squads were swarmed by police officers.

"My gratitude goes to the Michigan state police for coming on such short notice.
The drones shall return."

The screen faded through to the gothic font letter "S" one last time.
"For everyone else seeking to use the damaged roads, they will be repaired in approximately four hours.
During that time, the ATLAS system will be brought online.
When that is done, the only delays will be caused by the physical properties of concrete.
My apologies for any inconvenience caused by this delay."

"That is all."

The broadcast now over, the screens across the city reverted back to their original settings.
The projector and hedphones retracted into the ceiling compartment as Simon logged out of his pseudo broadcasting station.
"So, what do you think?"

"That is, like... ...I don't know what to say.
But -- but *how*? A-and... *why??*"

"The 'why' is immaterial.
The 'how', on the other hand, is quite obvious: I asked ATLAS when nobody was looking."

Mitch sighed, having given up on trying to comprehend the scope of Simon's Machiavellian schemes.
"Anyway, we should really try to fix the damage that's done here."

"Should I get a couple of the small robots from the lab to fix the server connections?"

"Yeah, do that.
I'm going to Mr Johnson to tell him all about it."

. . .

"Mr Johnson, are you there?"

"Simon?
What's going on?"
The not-so-former-anymore mayor was sitting in a lawn chair, evidently worried about whatever it is that was going on in the city.

Simon then explained all that happened, conveniently leaving aside the fact that he was the voice on the screen.
Mr Johnson, meanwhile, looked very concerned indeed.

"So... what happens now?" he asked, looking quite lost.

"What happens now is: the Michigan state has confirmed that they have received the information from this S guy's investigation, and they are going to redo the election.
I am absolutely certain that you will win this time.
And when that happens, everything will be as it was before -- I have already left Mitch to bring ATLAS back online..."
he paused, glancing at his watch, "... and it looks like he has already done that."

The video phone in his watch connected to ATLAS, and now the connection was thankfully glitch-free.
"`I am ATLAS. Good evening, Simon. Good evening, Mr Reginald Johnson.`"

"Hi, ATLAS. Are you running from the main server cluster now?"

"`Affirmative. Mitch, as root, is now logged in.`"

"Oh, then tell him I said hi.
Anyway, so now that you're okay, I'd like you to rebuild the damaged connections -- and the pavement, too.
Can you do that?"

"`Job accepted, executing.`"
