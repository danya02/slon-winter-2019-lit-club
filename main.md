"Nothing built can last forever."

"That's not what you said when we were building this thing in the first place!"

"Hey, I wasn't expecting it to break so soon!"

"That just shows the importance of unit-testing."

It was a nice sunny day.
The city of Detroit was bustling with activity.
For the first time in a long while, the people decided that going out is a good idea.

The company Virtudyne had undertaken the task of raising the city from its decade-long economic depression, and they have succeeded.
They have introduced an artificial intelligence designed with this goal in mind.
They called it the Autonomous Three-space Logistics Augmentation System, or ATLAS.

Its unique selling point was that it always found the most expedient method for completing any task.
Because of this, it has been able to increase the productivity of every business in the city tenfold in under an hour.
It did this by micromanaging actions done by every device that could help in any way.

In other words, it made everything useful. Efficient. Effective.

But it soon became obvious that the easiest way forward would be to improve people themselves.
So ATLAS used neural implant technology to get them to do more efficiently.

This went against its original goal: ATLAS was designed to help people, not use them.
So Simon, the systems architect, and Mitch, the lead systems administrator, took it upon themselves to fix it.

So while the citizens of Detroit were rejoicing at their freedom and enjoying their city's rise in economy, these two techies were hard at work fixing the algorithm.

"So how do you define a human face anyway?" said Mitch, typing away at his laptop.

"It might be wiser to limit the selection to robots only for now -- it's gonna crash again if it's so inclusive." said Simon, standing in front of a translucent blue window saying "ATLAS Management Console v.2.0.5 -- OK to boot?"

"So what I'm gonna do is test if the entity is in the same three-space as a robot, and initialize a link if it's there."

"Yeah, great. So push that into the repo, and I'm starting the test suite."

The blue dialogue box flickered for a few secods with the words "Restarting..." before switching back to "ATLAS Management Console v.2.0.7 -- Start unit testing?"

"Right, the update's been accepted, the robot factory is online and at capacity, let's do this." said Simon, pushing the OK button.

Behind him, the shiny new contraption -- the jury-rigged robot factory -- sprang to life, and immediately, a variety of automatons, big and small, walked out of the front doors.
The tiny transportation drones, the humanoid assembly workers, the elephantine mobile construction units -- all of them lined up in a grid on the main square, just as the modal window flashed the words "Test 1 -- Build+Control -- PASSED".

"OK, so that's working, let's start the main business logic shall we?" said Mitch, typing arcane commands into his laptop, and the infobox disappeared, making way for the "ATLAS Management Console -- Main Menu".

"`Good evening, Simon. Good evening, Mitch.`" said an unseen voice from the intricate machine on the city's main square.

"Ah, hi ATLAS. Could you please upgrade the robot factory so it's more stable?" said Simon, looking at the machine's screen, now showing a asidjiqweniunsdifnohijnwioennjoffbugioiejrowrjnukjnzajkunfijowjeron.
"By the way, did you improve your GUI?"

"`Affirmative. There was 792.94 seconds of idle CPU cycles, so I have created a 3D model based on the highest-rated person in this year's world beauty contest.`"

"Good for you! Anyway, the factory specs are in the schematic file on the latest branch of the repo."

"`Reading... Reading complete. Sending job to nodes.`"

The robots behind them immediately started walking toward the cobbled-together device they came from, dismantling it and simultaneously building a new one.
Three minutes later, the old one is completely gone, and a new, much more stable one, occupies its place.

"`Job done. Awaiting commands.`"

"Good AI. Now, could you please try and maximize stats 5, 9, 24 and 107, and minimize stat 39?"

"`Job accepted. Executing.`"

The robots, now crowded around the reassembled factory, scattered in various directions.

"Thank you. Well, that's that then, log us out please."

"`You have logged out. To log in again, please say your passcode in your language of choice.`"

"Oh, by the way Simon," said Mitch, packing away his laptop, "didn't you get Mr Johnson to buy a lot of these Model TX helmets?"

"Oh right I did, I forgot we could just build a robot factory."

"So what we gonna do, tell him it wasn't necessary?"

"Okay, sure, let's go.
He might enjoy that we've been able to reduce the price.
Do you remember the teleporter coords?"

"Sure do!"

. . .

The teleporter dropped them off near the home of Reginald Johnson, the city's mayor.
While the mayor was, indeed, a wealthy man, his house did not resemble the houses of his equally-rich colleagues.
Indeed, while other houses had all sorts of curious electronic delights on every surface, his was a great example of a mansion of Vitruvian proportions -- only large.

Mr Johnson himself was walking around the garden, surveying his front lawn orchard, and just as Simon stepped into the garden, he tore his eyes away from one particularly interesting shrubbery, saying:

"Ah, hello Simon -- oh, and Mitch too!
What brings you here?"

"Good morning, Mr Johnson," said Mitch, glancing at the (admittedly very nice) shrubs surrounding him, "we just wanted to tell you we found a way to use actual robots to..."

"Ah, that's all very well and good, but I'm sorry boys, I've retired from office, so..."

"You've *WHAT??*"

"Retired. I've realized I've grown too old for all this new AI technology.
I have to pass the reins, as it were, to someone who knows this sort of thing well."

"And that person might be?.." asked Simon, fearing the worst.

"Mr {{x}}, a asidjiqweniunsdifnohijnwioebuggeroffioiejrowrjnukejnazajakunfijoweneron!"

The distant thunderclap and neighing horses confirmed their suspicions.
This was *the* Mr {{x}}, He Who Waits Behind The Wall.
He was infamous for his efforts to sabotage Virtudyne's research into AI technology.
