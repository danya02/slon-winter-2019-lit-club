"Nothing built can last forever."

"That's not what you said when we were building this thing in the first place!"

"Hey, I wasn't expecting it to break so soon!"

"That just shows the importance of unit-testing."

It was a nice sunny day.
The city of Detroit was bustling with activity.
For the first time in a long while, the people decided that going out is a good idea.

The company Virtudyne had undertaken the task of raising the city from its decade-long economic depression, and they have succeeded.
They have introduced an artificial intelligence designed with this goal in mind.
They called it the Autonomous Three-space Logistics Augmentation System, or ATLAS.

Its unique selling point was that it always found the most expedient method for completing any task.
Because of this, it has been able to increase the productivity of every business in the city tenfold in under an hour.
It did this by micromanaging actions done by every device that could help in any way.

In other words, it made everything useful. Efficient. Effective.

But it soon became obvious that the easiest way forward would be to improve people themselves.
So ATLAS used neural implant technology to get them to do more efficiently.

This went against its original goal: ATLAS was designed to help people, not use them.
So Simon, the systems architect, and Mitch, the lead systems administrator, took it upon themselves to fix it.

So while the citizens of Detroit were rejoicing at their freedom and enjoying their city's rise of their economy, these two techies were hard at work fixing the algorithm.

"So how do you define a human face anyway?" - said Simon, typing away at his laptop.
